## For developers

Quite often, when I start learning programming on a new platform, I find even the simplest examples too complicated.
Tutorials, written by experts, with years of experience programming on that platform, sometimes forget how difficult those first step are.  
This is why I decided to make all my Minecraft mods publicly available, and documented them meticulously.


## Requires
